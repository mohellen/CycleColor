This is a folk from vim-script/CycleColor, which is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1457

This script provides a function, CycleColor (which is mapped to F4), to cycle through (almost) all available colorschemes. 

Because the script uses \":colorscheme\" rather than \":source\" to set the colorscheme, if there are two files with the same name in different directories in rtp, only the first one will be used (thus \"almost\" above).

The original version hard coded the search directory for colorschemes, i.e., ~/.vim/colors.
Due to the common use of vim plugin managers, colorschemes do not always reside in this dir. 
This folk version modified the script to search for a 'colors' subdir inside ~/.vim and use the first found subdir as the search directory for colorschemes.
